# video-player

Java script based Video Player

Just created a video element gave a Id name

Now using JavaScript
Created a var and which gets value from input group
created attribute of video name src 
and passed the value from input to src

Same goes with iframe which work as g-drive player
## So every time you enter link in input it will be the src attribute of video tag
